To calculate the damage multiplier for Pokémon with two types, you need to consider the effectiveness of the move against both of the Pokémon's types and then multiply these effectiveness values together. Here's how to do it:

Determine the Effectiveness Against Each Type:

Each type has a multiplier based on the move's effectiveness: Super Effective (2x), Not Very Effective (0.5x), No Effect (0x), or Neutral (1x).
For example, a Fire-type move has a 2x multiplier against Grass but a 0.5x multiplier against Dragon.
Multiply the Multipliers Together:

If a Pokémon has two types, multiply the effectiveness multipliers for each type together to get the overall multiplier.
For instance, if a Fire-type move is used against a Grass/Dragon Pokémon, you multiply 2x (against Grass) by 0.5x (against Dragon), resulting in an overall multiplier of 1x.
Apply the Overall Multiplier:

The final multiplier is applied to the move's base damage to calculate the total damage done to the dual-type Pokémon.
Remember that immunities take precedence. If a move has no effect against one of the Pokémon's types (0x multiplier), the overall multiplier will be 0x, regardless of its effectiveness against the other type.
